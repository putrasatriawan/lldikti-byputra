                                My hero when I was a kid was my mom. Same for everyone I knew. Moms are untouchable.
                                They’re
                                elegant, smart, beautiful, kind…everything we want to be. At 29 years old, my favorite
                                compliment is being told that I look like my mom. Seeing myself in her image, like this
                                daughter
                                up top, makes me so proud of how far I’ve come, and so thankful for where I come from.
                                the refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece.
                                The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It uses mirrors to
                                focus the
                                image that you eventually see.
                                Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to give you a good clear image
                                of what
                                you are looking at. You want your telescope to have good collimation so you are not
                                getting a
                                false image of the celestial body.
                                Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But it’s an
                                important word
                                because the aperture of the lens is the key to how powerful your telescope is.
                                Magnification has
                                nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture.
                                Focuser is the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you will look
                                through,
                                in place. The focuser has to be stable and in good repair for you to have an image you
                                can rely
                                on.
                                Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope sits on. The
                                mount is
                                the actual tripod aassets wedge is the device that lets you attach
                                the telescope to the
                                mount.
                                Moms are like…buttons? Moms are like glue. Moms are like pizza crusts. Moms are the ones
                                who
                                make sure things happen—from birth to school lunch.</p>
